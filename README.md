# Labang Online

The primary purpose of LabangOnline is to modernize and digitize the delivery of barangay-level services in Barangay Labangon, Cebu City. At present, residents face long queues, delays, and limited transparency due to the barangayâ€™s reliance on manual, paper-based processes. By creating a localized digital platform, this project directly addresses these inefficiencies and ensures that essential services such as certificate requests, complaint filing, and service inquiries are accessible anytime and anywhere.
